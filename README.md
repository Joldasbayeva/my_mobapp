What is the problem? And where is the challenge->I had a hard time cleaning up the data in this project, because I used the replace() method a lot to clean up the data.

## Description
How have you solved the problem->In solving this problem, I realized that before the data is updated, it should be written after the data is loaded, and in some places, the '.str' method should be used correctly when using replace().

pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install plotly
I use this libraries.
